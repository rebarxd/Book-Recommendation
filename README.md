# Litera Search Machine Learning

This code implements a collaborative filtering-based recommender system for books. It first filters users who have rated more than 200 books and selects books that have received at least 50 ratings. The resulting DataFrame is then transformed into a pivot table for further processing.

Cosine similarity scores are calculated between books based on user ratings. The **`recommend`** function takes a book title as input, finds its index in the pivot table, and identifies the most similar books using cosine similarity scores. The function returns a list of recommended books along with their authors, sorted by similarity.

In the provided example, when 'Animal Farm' is given as input, the system recommends four books: '1984' by George Orwell, 'Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging: Confessions of Georgia Nicolson' by Louise Rennison, 'Midnight' by Dean R. Koontz, and 'Second Nature' by Alice Hoffman, based on their similarity to 'Animal Farm' in terms of user ratings.

A function named recommend_library provides recommendations for libraries based on the user's geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude). The haversine function is used to calculate the distance between two sets of latitude and longitude coordinates. The library data is read from a CSV file, and the distances between the user's location and each library are computed and added to the DataFrame. The DataFrame is then sorted by distance, and the recommendations are formatted as a list of dictionaries. The distances are rounded to two decimals, and the recommendations, along with their distances, are returned as a JSON response. If an error occurs during the process, an error message is returned with a 400 status code. The recommendation system utilizes the Haversine formula to provide accurate distance calculations for suggesting nearby libraries to users.
